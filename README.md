PythonDesktop-old
=================

Past python desktop displays

These are just a few old bits of Python code I wrote up to pull down, parse, and format various XML feeds, to show up on my desktop.

Currently, many of these will error out.

Future:

Unless I want to display this information on my desktop again (unlikely), I will not be working on these.

----

I have also included some old scripts to integrate with Quicksilver, such that when triggered by ActionScript, they would upload the given documents to Google Docs.
